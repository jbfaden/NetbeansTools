More Netbeans Tools including "select in favorites"

Another Netbeans Tool I've always wanted to make is "paste with replace", which when pasting allows you to replace content before it is inserted.  A use case for this is when filling in getBoolean, getFloat, getLong code.

See also https://github.com/jbfaden/nbfollow (NBFollow), where I didn't realize I already had a spot for future netbeans tool projects.
